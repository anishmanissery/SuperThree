SuperThree is an MIT licensed open-source project that is completely free to use. Your contributions enable me to dedicate more time to enhancing the SuperThree indicator and developing new indicators, all of which will be released under the open-source MIT license and made available to everyone at no cost.

Sponsorships can be made via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/anishmanissery) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/anishmanissery). Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are welcome. Sponsors will receive logo placements as outlined in the [Sponsorship Tiers](https://github.com/sponsors/anishmanissery).
