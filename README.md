SuperThree uses a unique color-coding system to represent different market conditions and potential trading opportunities:

- **Uptrend (Green Fill)**: This is indicated by a green fill. An uptrend is a period where prices are increasing overall, indicating a bullish market. It’s an ideal time for traders to consider entering long positions or exiting short positions.

- **Downtrend (Red Fill)**: This is represented by a red fill. A downtrend is a period where prices are decreasing overall, indicating a bearish market. Traders might consider entering short positions or exiting long positions during this phase.

- **Sideways Trend (Blue Fill)**: This is shown by a blue fill. A sideways trend, also known as a horizontal trend, is when the price is relatively stable and not making significant upward or downward movements. It’s often a period of consolidation before the price moves up or down.

- **Counter-Trend Momentum (Blue Arrows)**: Blue arrows indicate counter-trend momentum, which can be a signal to exit trades or look for potential trend reversals. These are crucial points where the market’s momentum is shifting and may be about to move in the opposite direction.

The SuperThree indicator is an enhancement of the Supertrend indicator, providing additional features and visual cues to help traders make informed decisions. However, like all indicators, it should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis to confirm signals and avoid potential false positives.
